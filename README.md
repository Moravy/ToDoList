This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was created for the purpose of learning React, API, GCP SQL and GCP FUNCTION. 

This project is a todo list web application. I uses React, SQL and API to create this application. The todo List application will use an Google Function which connect to  Google PSQL that hosting on my Google Cloud. It has the functionality of add, delete and insert.

Google Function was used so that I can make the API serverless.
Google SQL was used so that I can learn how to use SQL and what the difference betweens PSQL and GCP SQL.
